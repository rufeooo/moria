To compile the program on Linux run cc.sh. Another platform may be specified
as the first argument to the script: 
amiga     ibmpc    mac   atari_st  unix    vms

The game needs to be installed setuid on UNIX systems for the scoreboard
to work.  Use the command 'chmod 4511 moria' to do this.
The file scores should be mode 644 with the same owner as moria.
(Or just type 'make install' after setting BINDIR and LIBDIR in the
Makefile to appropriate values.)

There are two choices for the key bindings, the original style and
a rogue-like style.  You can choose which one is to be the default
by changing the value of ROGUE_LIKE in config.h.

Moria only has partial support for SYS III.  It probably won't
compile and run under this system without a bit of work.

If your compiler has a seven character identifier limit, the shortnam.sed
file should solve the problem nicely.
